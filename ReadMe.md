A series of online courses offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). I would like to say thanks to Prof. [**Andrew Ng**](www.andrewng.org) and his colleagues for spreading knowledge to normal people and great courses sincerely. This course laid a path for ML & DL enthusiast to follow.

### Note

---

This repository is created as a reference to go to in future for academic related work. Feel Free to make use of this repository while you are doing Deep Learning specialization.

**Please only use it as a reference**. The quiz and assignments are relatively easy to answer, hope you can have fun with the courses.
